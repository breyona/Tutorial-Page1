                <u><i><b>FUNCTIONS</b></i></u> </h2>
                <b>A function contains some code that will be executed by an event or a call to that function. A function is a set of statements. You can reuse functions within the same script, or in other documents. You define functions at the beginning of a file (in the head section), and call them later in the document. To create a function you define its name, any values ("arguments"), and some statements.Arguments are variables that will be used in the function. The variable values will be the values passed on by the function call.

                By placing functions in the head section of the document, you make sure that all the code in the function has been loaded before the function is called.
                
                Some functions return a value to the calling expression.</b>

                        <u><i><b>CONDITIONALS</b></i></u></h2> 
                        <section><b>Logic is used to make decisions in code; choosing to run one piece of code or another depending on the comparisons made. This requires use of something called a conditional. There are a few different conditionals that you might want to use, but we’ll just focus the one used most commonly: if.

                        <br>
                        <section> 

                        It’s very simple: if some logic (the condition) is true, run a block of code. You can also supply more code to be run if the condition is not true, and supply additional conditions and blocks of code to optionally be run. These forms are called if-else.</b>
